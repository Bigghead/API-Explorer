# API-Explorer

## Take home test for a company


**Project Requirements**

* Create an interactive, browser-based tool for exploring endpoints on an API. This tool will accept parameters describing an endpoint (values such as url, method, headers, body etc) and produce an html component for sending requests to that endpoint.

* Given an API endpoint configuration, render a single API explorer component.

* All fields in the configuration above should be displayed to the user.

* The user should be able to set request body parameters according the the inputs defined by the "body" configuration. Note: this is only applicable on POST and PUT requests where a request body is used.

* The user should be able to click a "Send request" button that will send the user's customized request the url.
*The component should display the server's response to the user after the user clicks "Send request."
